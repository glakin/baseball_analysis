# baseball_analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze the success of baseball franchises through a lens of competence, rather than excellence. Instead of focusing on winning percentage or playoff success, my focus was on which franchises have been most successful at fielding competitive teams year in and year out. To do this, I looked at how often teams finished with a record of at least .500. I found which teams have been most and least successful at finishing .500 or above in their histories, and also looked at rolling 10-, 20-, and 30-year periods to determine which teams have had the best peaks and the worst troughs. 

I am planning to put together an R Markdown file that will combine the R code with summarized results. For now, the best way to review the code is to run the franchise_competence.R file. Note that you will need access to Lahman's Baseball Database (http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) in order to run the code.
